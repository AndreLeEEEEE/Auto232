    /* This information is irrelevant because the hardware is supposed to be detecting the chain links and not the trolleys
    Length between trolleys (inner) - 22.5 in
    Length between trolleys (outer) - 27 in
    
    Difference between inner and outer length - 4.5 in
    Diameter of trolley - 2.25 in
    Radius of trolley - 1.125 in
    Length between center of trolleys/Distance between the same sides of two trolleys (ex. left side to left side) - 24.75 in
    Calculated amount of time to traverse a trolley (w/slowest speed) = 2.8125 s
    Calculated amount of time to travel distance between two trolleys (w/slowest speed) = 28.125 s
    
    At the slowest speed, calculations say that a single trolley should take at max 2.8125 s to pass the metal detector
    from end to end. Calculations also say that a single trolley should take at max 28.125 s to go from the end of one
    trolley to the beginning of the next.

    Something to note is that there aren't any other distances on the belt to cover. On the I-beam, the distribution
    of trolleys are even. Thus, we're left with the length between trolleys and the length of a trolley.

    Length of single and double chain link - 4.25 in
    Length of gap in double link (estimate) - 80% of total length = 3.4 in
    Time to pass a single link - 5.3125 s
    Time to pass a gap (estimate) - 4.25 s

    s - g - s - g - s - g - s - g - s - g

    5.3125 - 4.25 - 5.3125 - 4.25 - 5.3125 - 4.25 - 5.3125 - 4.25 - 5.3125 - 4.25 = 57.375

    Assuming the line is traveling nonstop at its slowest speed, 4 ft/min, there should be 
    around 10 new entries in the log file per minute. This is the minimum amount of 
    entries the log file must provide in a minute before the line is deemed halted.
