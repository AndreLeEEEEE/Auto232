    Fastest recorded time - 7 ft/min = 1.4 in/s
    Slowest recorded time - 4 ft/min = 0.8 in/s
    Length between trolleys (inner) - 22.5 in
    Length between trolleys (outer) - 27 in
    
    Difference between inner and outer length - 4.5 in
    Diameter of trolley - 2.25 in
    Radius of trolley - 1.125 in
    Length between center of trolleys/Distance between the same sides of two trolleys (ex. left side to left side) - 24.75 in
    Calculated amount of time to traverse a trolley (w/slowest speed) = 2.8125 s
    Calculated amount of time to travel distance between two trolleys (w/slowest speed) = 28.125 s
    
    At the slowest speed, calculations say that a single trolley should take at max 2.8125 s to pass the metal detector
    from end to end. Calculations also say that a single trolley should take at max 28.125 s to go from the end of one
    trolley to the beginning of the next.

    Something to note is that there aren't any other distances on the belt to cover. On the I-beam, the distribution
    of trolleys are even. Thus, we're left with the length between trolleys and the length of a trolley.
