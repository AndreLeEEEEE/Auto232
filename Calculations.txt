    Fastest recorded time - 7 ft/min = 1.4 in/s
    Slowest recorded time - 4 ft/min = 0.8 in/s
    Length between trolleys (inner) - 22.5 in
    Length between trolleys (outer) - 27 in
    
    Trolley can also replaced with buckle since I believe that the buckle that connects to the trolley
    is of the same width. 
    
    Difference between inner and outer length - 4.5 in
    Diameter of buckle - 2.25 in
    Radius of buckle - 1.125 in
    Length between center of buckles/Distance between the same sides of two buckles (ex. left side to left side) - 24.75 in
    Calculated amount of time to traverse a buckle (w/slowest speed) = 2.8125 s
    Calculated amount of time to travel distance between the same sides of two buckles (w/slowest speed) = 28.125 s
    
    At the slowest speed, calculations say that a single buckle should take at max 2.8125 s to pass the metal detector
    from end to end. Calculations also say that a single buckle should take at max 28.125 s to go from the end of one
    buckle to the beginning of the next.
