User Instructions for Auto Line Monitor Software

The executable for this project is called 'GenerateAutoReport.exe'.

It's located within the shared network drive, 'PCMRP (P:)', in the folder labelled 'ricksr'.

Running GenerateAutoReport.exe requires no input from the user. However, the user should understand 
what occurs when the executable is ran. 

First, the program searches for and reads in the file, 'AUTOLINE LOG FILE.txt', from the folder, 'LogFiles'.
Second, any data in the log file will be saved to a separate text file in the folder, 'Log Archive'.
Third, the log file will be cleared of all data.
Fourth, an excel sheet containing the analyzed data will be generated in the folder, 'Reports'.

There are a few things to note about this process.

The program can be run on varying lengths of time. A report can be generated from a log file containing 
a week's worth of data, a few days, a month, and etc. This means the user can run the executable on any day.
However, this should only occur at the end of the paint line's workday as to avoid the processing of incomplete data.
The latest the paint line can end on weekdays is 4:30 pm, while on Satuday it's 2:30 pm.

Once the user clicks on the executable, be warned that the log file will be cleared of all data. Should the user
want to view the raw data, they need to look for the corresponding file in 'Log Archive'.

Since the user can run the executable on any day, combined with the fact that Sundays, Saturdays, and holidays exist, 
the naming scheme for archived log files and reports is broad. Appended to the end of either type of file is a date. 
This date is the most recent day recorded in the log file at time of processing. So if the user needs to know how 
much the paint line moved on a certain day, they need to look for the archived log file or report with the nearest 
date after the target day.

It's recommended that the user creates a shortcut of the executable and places that shortcut in a more convenient
location on the computer.
